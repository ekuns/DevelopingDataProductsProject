## Developing Data Products devdataprod-014 Class Project

This repo contains the class project for the May 2015 instance of the JHU
Coursera Developing Data Products class.

Contained in this repo is:

* A Shiny server app found in `server.R` and `ui.R` and `global.R`.
* An R Presenter presentation found in `ddp-presentation.Rpres`.

Data for the Shiny App is found in the data folder.  The file `runAppLocally.R`
is simply a convenience for running the Shiny App locally for testing.
